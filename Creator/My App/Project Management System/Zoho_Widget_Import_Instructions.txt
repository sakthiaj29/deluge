After creating the app,  
you can import the 2 widgets (separately) into the Widgets module.

3. Add the widget using the zip folder (you can find it inside the dist folder)  
4. Then click Create

#### Method 2: External Hosting
1. Name your Widget  
2. Select Hosting as External  
3. Paste your weblink in the Index File (you can run the code in localhost and copy the link)

Select the widget on the concurrent page (like Project Dashboard) under Modules and click Save.
